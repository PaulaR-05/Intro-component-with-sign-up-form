## Overview

Here is my solution‚ú®

I found the javascript part tricky, plus I couldn't do one of the email validations. If anyone can help me with coding tips, I'd be grateful ‚ù§Ô∏è

üòä Happy to hear any feedback and advice. Thanks!

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_
